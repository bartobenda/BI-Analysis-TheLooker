## This Project
### Project Goals and Motivation

The main objectives of this project were to analyze product performance, customer segmentation, and marketing effectiveness, in order to deliver actionable insights for optimizing product strategy, inventory management, and marketing campaigns.

1. **Demographics and Product Preferences**
   


   **Insight**: Customers range from 12 to 70 years old, with an average age of 41, mostly working professionals with families. 
   **Actions**: Tailor products and marketing to customer demographics for better conversion and personalized experiences.


   
   
                  
2. **Sales by Country and City**
   


  **Insight**: Shanghai, Beijing, and Seoul are top cities, while Brazil, the US, and China lead in sales by country.


  
  

3. **Product Category Performance**


   
   **Insight**: Sweaters and jeans contribute over 35% of revenue, while underperforming categories like accessories hurt profit margins by 10%.
   **Hypothesis**: Adjust pricing and inventory for low-performing categories while expanding successful ones.


   
                
   

4. **Traffic Source Performance**
   


  **Insight**: Search traffic generates the most revenue and holds a 30% profit margin, making it the most valuable traffic source.


  

  
5. **Revenue Impact and Sales Trends**
   
  

  


6. **Forecasting Future Sales Trends**



   **Insight**: Best-case forecasts show revenue growth, while worst-case predicts a 30% drop in 2024 due to economic downturn, with recovery by 2028.
